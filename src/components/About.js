                        <br />
                        <p>I'm a passionate QA Lead dedicated to ensuring the quality of the products people rely on. I began my journey in quality assurance back in 2016 during a Java development internship, where I discovered that delivering reliable, well-tested software is just as critical as building it. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked with talented teams to create robust, user-friendly products that are accessible even in remote areas. Outside of work, I love exploring test automation and innovative QA strategies, and when I'm not immersed in testing, I enjoy reading captivating books and embarking on new adventures.</p>
